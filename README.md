# Darren's AndroidTV Automation Framework

What is it?
* This is a basically an Android ADB shell commands automated using python.
* Currently, the script only works on 1 device directly connected to the PC.
* This only have 2 functions right now; launch an app and send remote keycodes to the TV

Requirements:
* Python 3 installed
* ADB installed and in the path
* Android TV

How to use?
* Import ADB_ActionScript.py, TV_App_Packages.py and Sony_Remote_Keycodes.py (works only for Sony TVs)
* Although you can use generic ADB keycodes found here: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent
* After that, you can now create your own script. See example xSample_Script.py
